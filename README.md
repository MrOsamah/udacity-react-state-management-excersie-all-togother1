# Udacity's React Nanodegree - React Fund. Exercise 1 - All Together

### Requirements:

1. Create a React app that lets us add a user's first name, last name, and username.
2. When the user is added, the number of games that he/she has played is defaulted to 0.
3. Each username has to be unique, so we cannot add multiple users with the same username, when tried error message appears.
4. The app should also display a list of users, specifically their usernames and the number of games they've played (which is defaulted to 0).
5. If someone tries to add a user when one of the fields is empty, the "Add" button should be disabled.
6. We should also have a button that lets us toggle between showing and hiding the number of games the users have played.
